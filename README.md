#The k-nearest neighbors method
//from wiki
(eng. K-nearest neighbors algorithm, k-NN) is a metric algorithm for automatic classification of objects or regression.
This is the most common form among {\ displaystyle k} k neighbors of a given element, whose classes are already known.
In the case of using a parameter for regression, the average value over {\ displaystyle k} k is the nearest object whose values are already known.
